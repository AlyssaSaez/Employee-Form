# ✨ Employee Form – React Component

This is a fun little React project I built for my Web Design & Development course. The form lets users add a new employee by entering their name, email, job title, and department.

It’s styled with custom CSS — including a gradient background, a glowy green-yellow button, and smooth hover effects. Everything’s responsive and built with accessibility in mind (because good design should work for everyone 💁‍♀️).

Honestly, I just wanted the form to look clean, modern, and like it had a little personality — and I think it does.

Thanks for checking it out! 💚
